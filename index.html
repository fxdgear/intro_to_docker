# What is Docker

From [docker.com](https://www.docker.com)

> Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

What does this mean?

Docker is a *container* utility that allows for bundling your application, and all dependencies in one "binary" file (image) which can be distrbuted to multiple hosts and executed (container).

---

# Container vs Image

There is a subtle different between an "image" and a "container". The container is what gets *run* the image is what gets *pulled*.

You can run multiple containers per host, and they all depend on the same image.

---

# Installing Docker

Docker runs nativly on __most__ linux variants.

To run docker on a Mac or Windows you'll have to install *boot2docker*.

Installation instructions can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/installation/

For those on a Mac and have homebrew installed you can also run:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install boot2docker
```

Once you've installed docker you can test if it's working by running `docker version`

---

# How to use Docker

Getting started with Docker is pretty simple and straight forward.

The easiest example is to just use an ubuntu image to echo something:

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu echo "hello world"
```

Lets hop into a bash prompt:


```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

---

# What's going on here?

---

# What's going on here?

So first thing that happened is the docker client
1. looked for the existance of an image named `ubuntu`, which wasn't found. So
2. it *pull*ed that image from the docker repository, then
3. it executed the `run` command on that image and
4. created a container to execute your command `echo "hello world"`

---

# So a container is just a way to make a virtual machine?

No, well kinda. But not really. A VM is very "thick"

.center[![vm_vs_container](mq2357Mt7.png)]

---

# So what's the difference?

As compared to a container which is much thinner:

.center[![vm_vs_container](mq23kqIF7.png)]

---

# Look at containers

```bash
docker ps
```

There's nothing here...

Lets run the bash command again, AND open a new terminal, and run `docker ps`

* `ps` will show us all running contaienrs
* `ps -a` will show us running and non running containers

---

# Logs

Using the `logs` command is a great way to view what happened to a container, and why it's not running or failed to start.

```bash
$ docker logs <container_id>
```

---

# Creating a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a way to "construct" an image for reusability.

```
FROM python:2-onbuild
CMD [ "python", "hello_world.py" ]
```

Code [sample](https://github.com/fxdgear/intro_to_docker/tree/master/examples/hello_world)

---

# Dockerhub

You've probably heard of Github.

Dockerhub is to Docker as Github is to Git.

Dockerhub allows you to

* store your images
* tag your images
* share your images
* hide (private) your images
* distribute your images

You can follow, star, keep up to date with images that you like or are interested in.

---

# Automated Builds

You can also setup "automated builds", so that when you push code to github, dockerhub will automatically build your image for you.

---

# Sign Up for an Account

You can sign up for a Dockerhub account at https://hub.docker.com

After you've created your DockerHub account you'll need to run `docker login` on the command line.

This will save your identity to the Docker client.

This will allow you to pull/push repos that you have permission to access (ie yours or other private repos).


---

# Docker Compose

Docker-Compose (formerlly known as Fig) is the way to orchestrate and compose your docker containers to work together.

Say you have a python web app, that uses Redis, Postgres, RabbitMQ.

In the traditional VM world you could (or would) install Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis, Python and all your other dependencies into your VM and call it good.
Then configure your app to communicate to `localhost` or what ever. This is pretty good for doing local development cause you don't need a distributed system for local dev.

Then when it comes to deploying your application you're going to have to setup everything again, in a new VM running on `<instert your favorite VPS service>`

More docs at http://fig.sh

---

# Why Compose

Compose makes it extremly simple to setup an environment that runs the same exact code, same exact dependencies that you'd have in production.

---

# Example

(Stolen from https://fig.sh)

```yml
web:
  build: .
  command: python app.py
  links:
   - db
  ports:
   - "8000:8000"
db:
  image: postgres
```

# What's Next?

* Docker Machine
* Docker Swarm
* Using Machine, Swarm, Compose to not only do development, but also deployments
