# What is Docker

From [docker.com](https://www.docker.com)

> Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.

What does this mean?

Docker is a *container* utility that allows for bundling your application, and all dependencies in one *binary" file (image) which can be distrbuted to multiple hosts and executed (container).

---

# Container vs Image

There is a subtle different between an "image" and a "container". The container is what gets *run* the image is what gets *pulled*.

You can run multiple containers per host, and they all depend on the same image.

---

# How to use Docker

Getting started with Docker is pretty simple and straight forward.

The easiest example is to just use an ubuntu image to echo something:

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu echo "hello world"
```

Lets hop into a bash prompt:


```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

# What's going on here?

So first thing that happened is the docker client
1. looked for the existance of an image named `ubuntu`, which wasn't found. So
2. it *pull*ed that image from the docker repository, then
3. it executed the `run` command on that image and
4. created a container to execute your command `echo "hello world"`

---

# So a container is just a way to make a virtual machine?

No, well kinda. But not really. A VM is very "thick"

---

# So what's the difference?

As compared to a container which is much thinner:

# Creating a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a way to "construct" an image for reusability.

```
FROM python:2-onbuild
CMD [ "python", "hello_world.py" ]
```
